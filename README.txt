# Before Running:

# Check if the dataset is populated with folders of images of colors.
# If it is not, then run data_grabber.py and allow for the folder to populate.

# How To Run:
# 
# 1. Place any .png images you'd like to generate a mosaic of inside the testimages folder (some samples provided)
# 2. Run driver.py
# 3. Enter the name of the image you'd like to create a mosaic for (do not enter the file extension).
# 4. Click the "check" button to see if the image can be found in the "testimages" folder.
# 4. Enter the size of each unit you'd like for the picture (smaller = more detail = longer runtime).
# 	    Good example unit size = 20
# 5. Click the "Generate" button and wait until the mosaic is finshed! 
# 6. When the mosaic is created, a window called "Result" will appear.
# 7. Click on the "Result" window and view the mosaic! Close the "Result" window when done viewing.
# 8. Press the "New Mosaic" button and re-do steps 3-7 to generate a new mosaic, or close the "Mosaic Generator" window to quit!
