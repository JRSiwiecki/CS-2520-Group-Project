# Before Running:

# Check if the dataset is populated with folders of images of colors.
# If it is not, then run data_grabber.py and allow for the folder to populate.

# How To Run:
# 
# 1. Place any .png images you'd like to generate a mosaic of inside the testimages folder (some samples provided)
# 2. Run driver.py
# 3. Enter the name of the image you'd like to create a mosaic for (do not enter the file extension).
# 4. Enter the size of each unit you'd like for the picture (smaller = more detail = longer runtime).
# 	    Good example unit size = 20
# 5. Wait for the mosaic to generate! 
# 6. When the mosaic is created, a window called "Result" will appear.
# 7. Click on the "Result" window and view the mosaic! Close the window when done viewing.
# 8. Enter y to generate another mosaic following steps 3-7 or press n to quit!!
